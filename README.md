# LJInteraction_Modeling  
*Lennard-Jones Potential Simulation and Visualization*

This repository models the **Lennard-Jones (LJ) interaction** between particles and visualizes the potential as a function of distance. It demonstrates the effect of a cutoff distance on particle interactions and provides a clear illustration of the LJ potential curve.

## Features

- Implements the **Lennard-Jones potential** with a cutoff  
- Calculates potential values over a range of distances  
- Visualizes the potential with key markers:
  - Zero potential line  
  - Characteristic distance \(r = A\)  
  - Cutoff distance \(r_\text{cutoff}\)  
- Saves plots as PDF for analysis
